# Course Information

## Target audience
Master-level students with:
- basic linear algebra
- basic calculus
- Python programming fundamentals

## Learning outcomes
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Implement and evaluate Bézier, B-spline, and NURBS curves/surfaces.
2. Analyze continuity and curvature in surface models.
3. Apply surface fitting techniques to engineering datasets.
4. Interpret curvature and fairness metrics in manufacturability contexts.
5. Build an engineering workflow from data (point cloud) to surface representation.

## Assessment
- Laboratory assignments (individual)
- Final project (team or individual)
- Short report + reproducible notebook deliverables
