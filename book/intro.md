# Surface Modeling for Engineering Applications

Welcome to the course book for **Surface Modeling for Engineering Applications (Master Level)**.

This book has two goals:

1. **Foundations (Part A):** build the fundamental algorithms (curves, surfaces, continuity, curvature) *from scratch*.
2. **Engineering workflows (Part B):** use professional-grade libraries and pipelines to solve realistic problems (fitting, point clouds, fairness, manufacturability constraints).

## How to use this book
This book is designed as a hybrid between textbook and lab manual:

- **Theory chapters** explain concepts, derivations, and engineering implications.
- **Lab notebooks** contain runnable code and practical experiments.

You can read everything online and run notebooks directly in **Google Colab** with one click.

---

## Running the lab notebooks
Each notebook starts with a setup cell that:
1. clones the GitHub repository
2. installs dependencies
3. makes the `code/` folder importable

Always run that cell first.

## Engineering note
Surface modeling is not only about “nice shapes”.
In engineering, surfaces control:
- aerodynamic performance
- manufacturing feasibility
- tolerances and metrology
- toolpath constraints
- structural integrity (via curvature and stress concentration)

Throughout the book, you will find “Engineering notes” that connect the mathematics to real design and production constraints.
