# Surface Modeling for Engineering Applications — Course Book

This repository contains the course book and code for the Master-level course
**Surface Modeling for Engineering Applications**.

## How to use this book
- Read the course book as a website (published via GitHub Pages).
- Run the laboratory notebooks directly in Google Colab using the "Open in Colab" button.

## Running notebooks in Colab
Each lab notebook starts with a **setup cell** that:
1. clones this repository
2. installs dependencies
3. makes the `code/` folder importable

You should always run that cell first.

## Local installation (optional)
If you want to run notebooks locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
